This is a collection of progams for 2D and 3D beam and truss structures.

WARNING: before using one of these programs make sure you 
         backup your previous work ! and make sure that 
         you apply these in a safe sandbox (not having 
         an influence on other work).

There happens to be some documentation included in both the
source (files) and in the doc directory, the latter if this
was available at the time of the publication.

Kind regards, have fun and the usual YMMV disclaimers apply.
